I reproduced this web app and tried to imitate their design and main features. 

On this project I focused on implementing a shopping cart.

Once logged in, users can:
- Add products to their shopping cart
- Update the quantity, or Remove items
- See the total cost

The database includes 3 models: User, Products and Cart. When a user add a product to his cart, a new "cart item" will be added
to the Cart model with the user id and product id.
